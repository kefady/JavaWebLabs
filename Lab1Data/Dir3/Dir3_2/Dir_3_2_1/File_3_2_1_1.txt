Workers in Australia, have a new hotline they can call when they feel stressed and overworked. 
The new counselling service, called Talk2Me, will charge its users $2,97 per minute to talk to a counsellor who promises to “just listen” to their work complaints. 
Of course, the service offers more than just a friendly ear: the counsellors have special skills. 
It’s not the same as  just talking to a friend.  For one thing,  they do not interrupt with their own tales.  
Just make sure you don’t talk for too long, otherwise you could end up more stressed when you get the bill.
