A Scottish PE teacher has invented a new fitness craze, which is rapidly catching on. 
The Highland Hustle is a mix of Scottish Highland dancing, ceilidh steps and muscle toning exercises. 
Of course, it is also accompanied by fast funky music. 
At present, there is only one class, in Scotland, but there are several workout videos that can be downloaded from the official website. 
The routines, which last just half an hour, are designed for busy people with any fitness level. 
The workout promises to improve your level of fitness, but it will not teach you to be a highland dancer.
