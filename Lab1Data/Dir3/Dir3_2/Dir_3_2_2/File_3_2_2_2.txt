A woman accidentally deleted every digital photo she had ever taken. 
Amy Molloy lost 2,600 pictures, including those of her late husband. 
It happened when she transferred her pictures from her ex boyfriend’s laptop to a hard disc. 
She only discovered months later that the disc was empty. By that time, her ex had deleted all of the original pictures. 
Surprisingly, she was not totally devastated. In fact, she thinks that looking at old photos can keep us stuck in the past. 
In the days before digital cameras, photographs naturally aged, faded and wrinkled, just like people, and Amy thinks that maybe it’s better that way.
