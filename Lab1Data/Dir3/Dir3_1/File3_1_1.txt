Few people would choose a prison as the location for a special evening out. 
However, Italy has launched its first restaurant to be located in a real jail.  
At the Ingalera Restaurant in Bollate prison, Milan, there are four prisoners working as waiters and five others cooking in the kitchen, headed by a professional chef and a ma√Ætre. 
It is a ground-breaking project, which allows prisoners to be gradually included into society. 
The reataurant has had great reviews: everyone says the food is worth going to prison for.
